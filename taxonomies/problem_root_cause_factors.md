## Problem Domains and Issue Areas

This taxonomy focuses on potential user problems or issues. The h3 headers below can be best described as **Problem Domains** or **Issue Categories**. These headings broadly classify the types of challenges or difficulties that users might encounter during their journey with a product or service. These categories provide a structured way to analyze and address different aspects of the user experience that could be problematic.

The categories are coarser than the user journey phases in the User Journey Phases taxonomy, as they encompass a wider range of potential issues rather than sequential steps in the user's interaction. They are more thematic, each encompassing a distinct area where problems might arise, such as "Technical", "Product, Inventory, and Orders", "Payment, Invoicing, Cancellations", etc.

As for the numbered list categories under each h3 header, these can be termed as **Sub-Categories** or **Specific Issue Areas**. These sub-categories break down the broader problem domains into more specific areas of concern, allowing for a finer granularity in identifying and addressing user issues. They resemble user journey phases in that they map to specific aspects of the user's interaction with the product or service, but they are more focused on potential problems within those aspects rather than the steps of the journey itself.

For example, under the "Technical" domain, "App Usability" and "Account Management" are specific issue areas that detail the kinds of technical problems a user might face, such as "Login Issues" or "Server Downtime". These are more specific than the broader "Technical" category and offer a focused lens to examine and resolve specific types of user problems.
